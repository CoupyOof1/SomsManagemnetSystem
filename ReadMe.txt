This is a property management system allowing for admins to add admin accounts, property details and generate reports while the general users will only be able to search and view property they are interested in.


Due to the fact I haven't consider using PyCharm for the base IDE for creating the project, 
down below I have supplied a set of instructions to how to run it. 
      (RUNNING THE PROJECT)
1. Open Command Prompt on Windows
2. Locate the directory of the project (e.g. CD/User/PythonProject/)
3. Type in "py Main.py"
4. It should run and there you go
